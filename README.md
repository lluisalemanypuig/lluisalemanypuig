- 👋 Hi, my name is Lluís!
- 👀 I'm interested in extending my [main project](https://github.com/LAL-project/) and the tools built on it, all of which is the result of my research during my Ph. D. thesis.
- 💞️ I'm open to collaborating with people interested in making new tools built on the [Linear Arrangement Library](https://github.com/LAL-project/linear-arrangement-library) or extending the existing tools.
