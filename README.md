ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is LluÃ­s!

Here are some of the projects I've worked on:
- The [Linear Arrangement Library](https://github.com/LAL-project/), a library of optimization algorithms of linear arrangements of graphs. In the same repository, you'll find tools that make LAL easier to use, such as a python wrapper and a GUI to convert datasets into a format that LAL understands. I'm open to collaborating with people interested in making new tools built on LAL or extending the existing tools.

  Languages: C++, python.

- Throughout my career as a researcher I made extensive use of [ipe](https://ipe.otfried.org), for which I wrote two plugins (aka ipeletes):
  - To draw linear arrangements, called [ipe.embedviz](https://github.com/lluisalemanypuig/ipe.embedviz)
  - To automatically label objects, called [ipe.autolabel](https://github.com/lluisalemanypuig/ipe.autolabel)
  - To draw arrows between two objects, called [ipe.cappedarrows](https://github.com/lluisalemanypuig/ipe.cappedarrows)

  Languages: LUA

- I've also worked in chess-related projects, such as
  - A [webpage](https://github.com/lluisalemanypuig/elo-chess-tracker) for setting up an _internal_ Elo rating for a chess club. In this webpage, users log the games they play with other members of their club and then their internal Elo is updated automatically.
 
    Languages: typescript.

    (You may contact me if you're interested in using it in your club, but notice that it is free! Help in development is also welcome!)
  - A [chess puzzle database](https://github.com/lluisalemanypuig/chesspebase) explorer, where people can search for chess positions that match a specific configuration of the pieces (in type and number). This project uses a [data structure](https://github.com/lluisalemanypuig/classification-tree) that implements fast searches for data that can be classified using criteria which can be arbitrary in value and in number.
 
    Languages: C++, typescript.

  - A CLI application to easily add timestamps in a chess game, called [pgn-parser](https://github.com/lluisalemanypuig/pgn_parser).
 
    Languages: Rust

- I've developed some utility apps, such as:
  - An applet that updates the clue in a [Catalan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_language) word-building game, called [restalogic](https://www.vilaweb.cat/paraulogic/) (javascript).
  - A very simple Qt GUI to make QR codes, called [qr-encoder](https://github.com/lluisalemanypuig/qr-encoder) (C++)
  - A CLI application to help people keep track of their expenses, called [finances-manager](https://github.com/lluisalemanypuig/finances-manager). (Rust)
