- 👋 Hi, my name is Lluís!
- 👀 I’m interested in extending my [main project](https://github.com/LAL-project/) and the tools built on it, all of which is the result of my research during my Ph. D. thesis.
- 🌱 I’m constantly learning C++, mostly from [C++ weekly](https://www.youtube.com/c/lefticus1), [Cpp Con](https://www.youtube.com/user/CppCon), [CppOnSea](https://www.youtube.com/@cpponsea) and [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/12075306/llualpu).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with people interested in making new tools built on the [Linear Arrangement Library](https://github.com/LAL-project/linear-arrangement-library) or extending the existing tools.
- 📫 You will find contact information in my [work webpage](https://cqllab.upc.edu/people/lalemany/).
